THREAD TITLE: Convert localStorage to IndexedDB

And say: "Here are the files."
Then drag + drop them.

OBJECTIVE:

- Swap out localStorage for IndexedDB 
- Keep exact same API (saveEntries, getEntries) 
- Make it async without changing your UI calls 


FILES TO UPLOAD

1) JavaScript

File								Reason
-----								------  
root: index.js         					
entry-form.js						Where entries are created — we intercept data before saving
entry-display.js					Where entries are read and rendered
storage.js							This is the one that will be replaced by IndexedDB logic
/entry-display-helpers/* (folder)	For delete, edit, remove image, etc. since they reference storage
/helpers/update-attributes.js		Needed so nothing breaks, even though we won't modify it
lazy-load-intersection-observer.js	For completeness (won’t change, but good to have)


2) HTML

File					Reason
-----					------ 
index.html				So I can confirm element IDs, structure, script locations


3) CSS - Optional (but recommended)

File						Reason
-----						------
style.CSS					Only if there are classes affecting behavior.
							(IndexedDB conversion does not depend on CSS, but CSS sometimes reveals state logic.)

entry-display.js:
.focus-highlight
entry-display-helpers/
.save-edit
.journal-image-wrapper
.lazy-loaded-image
.lazy



entry-form.js:
.hide
.focus-highlight

entry-form-helpers/
.hide
